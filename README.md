# Department of Systems Engineering

This project is website development for the department.

We will be building from scratch parts of the website. The main website and information desk will be handled with WordPress by @geektutor.

The part that we will build are:

1. Online Clearance Management System - Each student will be assigned to a supervisor (imported from an excel sheet maybe with two column - Student matric number and supervisor username) and the supervisor will be able to approve that the person can be cleared. The project cordinator will now be able to clear each student and finally, the HOD can clear the student and the generated clearance document can be printed out. (Let me know if you need clarification here).

2. Each lecturer is able to upload result online and student can be able to see the result - we can have a form that asks for Course Code and the PDF file and students can go and view the result but they shouldnt be ble to download (let me know what you think too).

3. Complaint System - a form where student can send complaints and depending on the lecturer, it drops to the mail box of the staff.
